# Operations

Audience: whoever administers this repository and the machines it runs on.

## Branch protection

`main` takes a change only through a pull request whose gates are green. A
repository ruleset owns that — not the legacy per-branch settings — and this is
the command that created it. It is reproducible: `POST` refuses a second
ruleset of the same name, so an update sends the same body to
`PUT repos/overnightworks/agent-presentator/rulesets/<id>`, with the id that
`gh api repos/overnightworks/agent-presentator/rulesets` reports.

```sh
gh api --method POST repos/overnightworks/agent-presentator/rulesets --input - <<'JSON'

No bypass actor exists: an administrator is subject to the same gates, and
`main` cannot be deleted at all. Approvals are set to zero on purpose — this
repository is reviewed by agents before the pull request opens, not through
GitHub review requests. Only `squash` and `rebase` are offered because a merge
commit would violate the linear history the same ruleset requires.

`pr-check` runs from its own workflow on `opened`, `synchronize`,
`reopened`, and `edited`, so a body change after the first run still has
to pass the classification gate.

`SonarCloud scan` is deliberately not among the required checks yet. The job
runs and reports, but the quality gate still fails on the findings it collected
on `main`, and a required check that cannot go green blocks every pull request.
It joins the list above — and the live ruleset — with the first green gate.

## SonarCloud

The SonarCloud project is created by dispatching the one-off bootstrap
workflow, which also switches Automatic Analysis off:

```sh
gh workflow run sonar-bootstrap.yml --ref main
```

Running it again is harmless; it converges on the same state. Automatic
Analysis and the CI scan are mutually exclusive: while Automatic Analysis is
on, SonarCloud refuses the report the `SonarCloud scan` job uploads.
